1.3 2008-12-16
- Added AceSetUserClientAddress, but it appears only to be useful with
AceClientCheck, which is not yet implemented.
- Reduced size of prompt strings in line with RSA suggestions.
- Workaround for a bug in the AceAgent 6.1 SDK: AceContinueAuth promptStrLen
is unreliable.
- Modified Makefile.PL to work with SDK version 6.1.
- Updated doc for SDK version 6.1, which is now preferred.

1.4 2012-01-02
