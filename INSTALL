This module will build on Unix, Linux, Solaris, Windows NT, Windows Server
 200x with the ACE/Server client libraries version 4.1, 5.x and 6.1.

It requires the SecurID ACE/Agent client library or SDK
4.1 or better to be installed on your host first. The preferred version is
6.1. You will need to get ACEAgentSDK61.zip from
https://knowledge.rsasecurity.com, using your RSA support contract details.

If you are using ACE/Agent 4.4 for Windows NT, it will require you to
copy by hand the acesupp directory from the CDROM to c:\ace on you local
disk.1

If you are using ACE/Agent Authentication API for Unix, you will need
to copy by hand the ACEAgentSDK directory from the Authentication API
cdrom to the ACE directory, then adjust the paths in Makefile.PL
to suit.

Build instructions Windows
0. Obtain ACEAgentSDK61.zip from https://knowledge.rsasecurity.com
1. Unzip ACEAgentSDK61.zip into C:\ so it appears as C:\ACEAgentSDK
2. perl Makefile.PL
3. nmake
4. nmake test
5. nmake install

Build instructions Unix, Linux, Solaris
0. Obtain ACEAgentSDK61.zip from https://knowledge.rsasecurity.com
1. Unzip ACEAgentSDK61.zip into /opt/ace so it appears as /opr/ace/ACEAgentSDK
2. perl Makefile.PL
3. make
4. make test
5. make install

Notes:

Before you can test this package, you will need to have a working ACE
server, and a SecurID token assigned to a username that you can 
test with. 

The standard ACE/Agent library shipped with ACE/Server 4.1 for
Solaris (and HPUX, it is reported)
has a bug that prevents AceCloseAuth completing. 
You will need to get a patched version of libaceclnt.a
from RSA Security, or Open System Consultants, else upgrade
to version 5. ACE/Server 4.1 in now deprecated, so we recommend 
upgrading to version 5.

The machine that you run the tests on must be a valid ACE client, and
your username should be activated on that machine. The system you are
going to be testing from must already have the sdconf.rec
file installed (typically in /var/ace/sdconf.rec on Unix). On Unix
the user that runs the program that uses Authen-ACE4 must have
read access to the sdconf.rec file.

On Unix, you will need to set the VAR_ACE environment variable to point to the
location of a writeable directory containing the sdconf.rec file, else the
make test portion may fail. The sdconf.rec file is a ACE/Agent configuration
file that specifies how to contact the ACE/Server 
eg: 
VAR_ACE=/opt/ace/data make test

Because the interactive nature of SecurID requires you to enter a
time-sensitive token from a card, you cannot automate the test suite.
An ACE server will never accept the same token twice, so during the
testing, you may be prompted to wait for the token on the card
to change before continuing with the test.

The test program will display all codes in plain text.
