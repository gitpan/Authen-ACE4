This module will build on Unix and Windows NT with the ACE/Server
client libraries version 4.1 or better.

It requires the SecurID ACE/Agent client library or SDK
4.1 or better to be installed on your host first.

Build instructions:

1. Edit Makefile.PL, set sd_version to 4 or 5, depending on which
   version of the ACE/Agent library you are using.
   Then check and perhaps change the definition of $acedir to 
   the location of your ACE/Agent installation
2. perl Makefile.PL
3. make
4. make test
5. make install

Notes:

Before you can test this package, you will need to have a working ACE
server, and a SecurID token assigned to a username that you can 
test with. 

The standard ACE/Agent library shipped with ACE/Server 4.1 for
Solaris has a bug that prevents AceCloseAuth completing. 
You will need to get a patched version of libaceclnt.a
from RSA Security, or Open System Consultants, else upgrade
to version 5.

The machine that you run the tests on must be a valid ACE client, and
your username should be activated on that machine. The system you are
going to be testing from must already have the sdconf.rec
file installed (typicaly in /var/ace/sdconf.rec on Unix).

On Unix, you may need to set the VAR_ACE environment variable to 
point to the location of the sdconf.rec file, else the make test
portion may fail. The sdconf.rec file is a ACE/Agent configuration
file that specifies how to contact the ACE/Server eg:
VAR_ACE=/opt/ace/data make test

Because the interactive nature of SecurID requires you to enter a
time-sensitive token from a card, you cannot automate the test suite.
An ACE server will never accept the same token twice, so during the
testing, you may be prompted to wait for the token on the card
to change before continuing with the test.

The test program will display all codes in plain text.
